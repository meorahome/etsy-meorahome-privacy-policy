            <li>Organizing and accessing product images stored in the Operator's Google Drive</li>

            <li>Preparing content drafts (pin descriptions, titles, and images) for Pinterest</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            The Operator manually reviews, selects, and approves each individual pin before it is published to Pinterest. No content is published without the Operator's explicit action and approval. The App does not perform any bulk or unsupervised publishing.
        </div>

        <p>The App is not publicly available, has no end users, and does not provide services to external parties. It is used exclusively by the Operator for managing their own Pinterest business account.</p>
